# my printf
This project is a recreation of the `printf` function using system call `write` and other functions. The `printf` function is a commonly used function in the C programming language that allows the printing of formatted output. This project creates a similar function that can handle `%f`, `%s`, `%d`, `%c`, `%f`, `%x`, `%i` and more.
# How to Use
To use this `printf` function, first include the header file `printf.h` in your C program. Then, call the function `ft_printf` followed by the desired format specifier and arguments.
### Example Usage:

```
#include "printf.h"
int main() {
    ft_printf("The value of integer a is: %d\\n", a);
    ft_printf("The value of character c is: %c\\n", c);
    ft_printf("The value of string s is: %s\\n", s);
    ft_printf("The value of floating point number f is: %f\\n", f);
    return 0;
}

```
